This is a python program for spotting triangular arbitrage opportunities on Uniswap DEX. It can be modified to spot opportunities on other DEXs too.

This program will only spot and show TriArb opportunities, use it at your own risk.

In order to use the program for the very first time:

1. Get token pools.
2. Update structured pair list. This step will generate a json file with the structured pairs (Check the example file).
3. Update uniswap surface rates. This step will generate a json file with the surface rates with theoretical PnL (Check the example file).

Note 1: In order to update tradeable structured pair list you need to run Step 1 first.
